# Creating customer segments using different clustering algorithms

In this unsupervised learning project, we create customer segments of a wholesale distributor using several clustering algorithms. We start by normalising the data and having a look at outliers. We then reduce the dimensionality of the data by applying a PCA and we try different clustering algorithms:
- K-means
- Gaussian mixture model
- Agglomerative clustering
- DBSCAN

The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning repository and it is [available here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers).

**Toolkit:** Python, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Box-cox transformation, PCA, K-means, Gaussian mixture model, Agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN
